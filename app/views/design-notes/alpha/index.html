        <p class="govuk-body">In alpha teams try out different solutions to the problems they learnt about during discovery. We spent alpha building prototypes and testing different ideas.

                <li>Produced a prototype in Balsamiq (as an interaction designer had not yet joined the team)</li>
                <li>Initial hypotheses were defined and prioritised in various workshops</li>
                <li>A <a href="../version-1/start.html">journey was mapped and defined</a> based on our discovery research</li>
                <li>The prototype reflected this journey and otherwise followed the GOV.UK design system and content design guidelines</li>
                <li>The order of the design approximated the order of the paper calculation sheet</li>

            <p class="govuk-body">Our tech team discovered that writing information to NOMIS carried a large risk. As such, it was decided that inputting data would be removed from the scope of our service. Our service would calculate release dates based on information in NOMIS. This changed the overall journey and the hypotheses we would test.</p>

                <li>The types of sentences covered in Alpha are emphasised on start page.</li>

                <li>Added option to print calculation</li>
                <li>Reordered calculation summary to prioritise release dates, based on findings from user research</li>
                <li>Removed some information included in the calculation summary that duplicated that on the previous page, based in user research findings</li>
                <li>Revised check NOMIS screen to accommodate longer lists of sentences</li>
                <li>Added additional journeys for cancelling a calculation and reporting a problem</li>
                <li>Added banner to explain multiple offences for single sentences being automatically split into multiple sentences by our service</li>
