<h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-6">What this page does</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                On this page, users review the court case, sentence and offence information that has been entered into NOMIS and used in the calculation. 
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Before using the Calculate release dates service, users must enter sentence and offence information into NOMIS. Because of usability problems with NOMIS, this information can be difficult to enter and view. 
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">By laying out information clearly, the Calculate release dates service allows users to ensure that all information used in a calculation is present and correct.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">If any information is incorrect, users must correct it in NOMIS and reload this page to review changes.</p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Adjustments</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Adjustments that are to be applied to a calculation are also displayed on this page. It shows a summary of all adjustments, as well as more detailed information about some adjustments such as remand,  which may affect the outcome of a calculation.</p>
            <img class="govuk-!-margin-top-2 design-manual-img" src="{{ asset_path }}images/adjustments-1.jpeg" alt="" style="width:300px;">
            <img class="govuk-!-margin-top-2 design-manual-img" src="{{ asset_path }}images/adjustments-2.jpeg" alt="" style="width:300px; float: right;">
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-4">Include an ERSED date</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Currently there is no functionality in other services to identify a person who requires an ERSED (Early release scheme eligibility date) as part of their calculation. Until functionality in other services allows this, users must select to include an ERSED date in a calculation on this page using a checkbox.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">User research</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">Multiple versions of this page have been tested with users in user research and during the service's private beta phase.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">User research has shown us that users understand the page and are able to use it.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">We have heard from users that the layout of information makes it easy to read and understand, giving them confidence that the correct information is being used in the calculation.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Usability testing found that it is important to display a “0” when there are no adjustments of a particular type. This helps reassure users that information has not been missed and has been entered correctly. </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">In usability testing of previous iterations of the adjustment section, users wanted to see more detailed information about remand dates. This information is used by users to understand which sentence remand is applied to.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Future considerations</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">As the Digital warrant folder service replaces NOMIS for the input of court cases, sentence and offence information, the purpose of this page will change. We believe there will still be a user need to review the information used in a calculation, but will need to consider how this page integrates with that service.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Although initial user research suggests users are able to include an ERSED in the calculation, and understand the meaning of this, we must monitor this component over time. As ERSEDs are only applicable in a minority of calculations, users might develop a behaviour where they skip this, as it's not relevant in most cases.</p>
